== Introduction

SharedPrefKmm is a Kotlin multiplatform key-value data storage library with encryption by default

== Features

* Simple get() set() delete() API
* Encrypted by default with hardware-backed secure key storage on iOS and Android
* Support for storing `@Serializable` objects as well as primitives

== Supported Platforms

* Android
* iOS
* JVM/desktop
* wasmJs

== Usage Guide

=== Getting Started

. Integrate this library as a dependency in your project:
.. Add the Maven repository to your `settings.gradle`
... `maven("https://k1ra.net/nexus/repository/public")`
.. Add the dependency:
... `implementation("net.k1ra.shared_pref_kmm:SharedPrefKmm:latest.release")`
.. Add the following linker flag to `Other Linker Flags` in your Xcode project:
... `-lsqlite3`
. Use `SharedPreferences` in your project:

[source,kotlin]
----
//It is especially important on jvm/desktop for the collection name to be unique to your app
val pref = SharedPreferences("UniqueCollectionNameHere")

//Make a @Serializable object
val obj = TestObject("test", 123)

//Set it
pref.set("obj", obj)

//Get it
val storedObj = pref.get<TestObject>("obj")

//Delete it
pref.delete("obj")
----

== Security
On iOS and Android, encryption keys are stored securely, backed by the system keystore.
Unfortunately, because no such APIs exist on the desktop JVM, the encryption key is stored in a file in the application's data directory.
On wasmJs, temporarily, data is only stored for the life of the session

== Usage Examples

There are additional usage examples in the SharedPrefKmmDemo app and SharedPrefTest in this project

== Environment Setup

* Since this is a KMM project, a modern version of Android Studio (2023.1.1 or newer) is required
* Remember to configure Android Studio to use Java 17
